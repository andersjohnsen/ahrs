## Madgwick

Originally [published](https://www.x-io.co.uk/res/doc/madgwick_internal_report.pdf) in 2010 by Sebastian O.H. Madgwick, it offers an efficient orientation filter for IMU and MARG sensor data.

The Toit implementation is a port of the C and [C#](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Open-Source-AHRS-With-x-IMU) implementations.
